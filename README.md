# Summer2025-RogueLike

## Serious Game Design Document Outline
A game design document is the blueprint for your game. Include all necessary details to build the complete version of your game — even if you can’t implement everything yet. Think big but be clear about what features you’ve actually delivered.
 
1. Title Page (Required)
•	Game Name – Sets tone and identity.
•	Tagline – Short branding phrase (e.g., "Prepare to Die", "Gotta Catch 'Em All").
•	Team – Names and roles (include your client if applicable).
•	Date of Last Update
2. Revision History (Optional)
•	Use only if multiple versions or major design changes.
•	Include version numbers and change descriptions.
3. Game Overview (Required)
•	Purpose – Combine successful mechanics from Slay the Spire, Across the Obelisk, and Balatro into a fast-paced roguelite deckbuilder with creature combat.
•	Intended Use – Standalone release; first big indie title.
•	Justification – Builds on proven deckbuilding formulas to attract genre fans.
•	Target Audience – Roguelike fans and players of games like Pokémon TCG or Magic.
•	Genre(s) – Roguelike, Deckbuilder
 
4. Gameplay
•	Objectives – Defeat the final boss on the 4th plane using your built-up deck, creatures, and relics.
•	Game Progression and Play Flow – The game progresses through a graph-based map system, inspired by Slay the Spire.
Each "plane" features:
•	A tiered node map with branching paths
•	Nodes representing encounters: battles, shops, events, rest sites, and more
•	Players start at the bottom and choose paths leading toward a boss at the top
•	Choices affect deck growth, resource management, and team synergies
After each boss fight:
•	Players carry forward their cards, relics, gold, and creatures
•	The next plane increases in difficulty and strategic complexity
 
5. Mechanics (Key Section)
•	Rules – Explicit: card energy, turn limits, creature limits. Implicit: synergy rewards, deck size pressure.
•	Game World:
o	Physics – Not applicable.
o	Economy – Gold is earned from battles, used in shops to buy/remove cards or recruit creatures.

•	Character Actions:
o	Movement – Player moves node-to-node.
o	Combat – Turn-based card battles. Max 5 creatures per side. When a creature dies, it deals “Death Damage” to its owner.
o	Inventory – Player manages a deck, relics, and currency.
•	Screen Flow – List how players move between screens (e.g., Map → Battle → Reward → Map).
•	Game Options – Settings for difficulty, sound, UI, etc.
•	Replayability / Saving – Procedural runs with meta-progression. Saving between maps or fights.
•	Cheats / Easter Eggs – (Optional: include if any.)
 
6. Story and Narrative (Optional)
•	Backstory – Provide lore or worldbuilding (e.g., the purpose of the planes, factions, or summoning magic).
•	Plot Structure – Consider the Hero’s Journey or episodic arcs:
o	Act 1: First plane (initiation)
o	Act 2: Rising conflict (stronger enemies, moral decisions)
o	Act 3: Final boss and resolution
•	Narrative Delivery – Delivered through event text, dialogue, or card flavor.
